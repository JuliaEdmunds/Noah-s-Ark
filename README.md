# Noah's Ark
Final project for the Unity Junior Programmer Pathway 

## Project description
A casual game which will challenge your memory.

The game's goal is to gather a pair (female & male) of each animal type on the ark. Any repeating animal will make your ark sink so better watch out!

The difficulty settings allow the Player to customize the number of animal species as well as the number of lifelines that can be used in the game. It also offers 2D and 3D game modes.
