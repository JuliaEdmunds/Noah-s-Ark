# Noah's Ark
Final project for the [Unity Junior Programmer Pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer) and my 1st ever published game.

## Project goal
The aim of this project was to create an end-to-end game, publish it and learn/practice how to decouple logic and visuals.

## Project description
Noah's Ark is a casual game that challenges the Playerâ€™s memory. The goal is to gather a pair (female & male) of each animal type on the ark while any repeating animal will make the ark sink.

The difficulty settings allow the Player to customize the number of animal species as well as the number of lifelines that can be used in the game. It also offers 2D and 3D game modes.
